# 3drenderer
A 3D renderer made with python

It uses rotation matrices to spin the object around, and trigonometry to plot it to the screen.
This isn't fast, nor efficient, but this was just to learn about the math behind-the-scenes.

# REQUIRES:
PyGame, install it with pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Or if on linux-
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
```
